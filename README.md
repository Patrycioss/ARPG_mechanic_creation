# Making basic ARPG Mechanics in the Godot Game Engine

In this project I worked on making systems that one could build upon to make an ARPG in Godot. This was my first time using Godot so it took me a bit to get the hang of it. 
In the gifs below the fighting with a simple enemy is visible. You can also pickup items which in this case are hearts to restore health. 
The gif underneath the first one shows what dialogue would look like, the dialogue box can be edited. The idea is that every entity in the scene has its own name and picture 
so the dialogue can always make use of entities. It also shows that when the player is in range a prompt can appear to interact with an NPC. 

I used the character sprites of Frisk and Flowey from the game Undertale as I am not an artist and these look good in my opinion. 
I also used a sword animation made by [PixelOwen](https://www.deviantart.com/pixelowen/art/A-Sword-Swing-Animation-2D-873175006 )
